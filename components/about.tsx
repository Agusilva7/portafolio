          I am Agustin Silva, I am 20 years old, and I am a passionate 
          <span className='font-medium'> Frontend developer</span><br/>
          My first exposure to programming began when I started studying Computer Science at the National University of Lujan using Python. As it caught my attention, I enrolled in the Codo a Codo 4.0 program, where I gained a solid foundation in this versatile programming language.<br/>

        However, my turning point came when I decided to embark on the programming bootcamp at SoyHenry. During this intensive program, I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects. One of the highlights of my career so far was my internship at <span className='underline'>Calm es Simple</span>, where I worked on the refactoring of their website using modern technologies like Next.js, React, and TypeScript. During this experience, I learned to tackle complex challenges and provided creative solutions to improve the usability and performance of the site.<br/>

      Â¡I look forward to contributing to your next project and continuing to grow as a Frontend developer!
